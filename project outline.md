Great idea! Starting with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a single barbershop scheduling system is an excellent way to build a functional foundation before scaling to a SaaS. Here’s how you can outline the MVP version:

Database Design

Here’s an outline for your models:

1. Models

User:
	•	id
	•	name
	•	email
	•	password
	•	role (admin or customer)

Barber:
	•	id
	•	name
	•	specialization
	•	working_hours (e.g., 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
	•	breaks (optional)

Service:
	•	id
	•	name
	•	duration (in minutes)
	•	price

Appointment:
	•	id
	•	customer (ForeignKey to User)
	•	barber (ForeignKey to Barber)
	•	service (ForeignKey to Service)
	•	date
	•	time
	•	status (e.g., confirmed, canceled)

Key Django Implementation Steps
	1.	Project Setup:
	•	Create a Django project and app (e.g., barbershop).
	•	Set up models for User, Barber, Service, and Appointment.
	2.	Admin Panel:
	•	Use Django Admin to manage barbers, services, and appointments.
	3.	Booking Flow:
	•	Create views and forms for:
	•	Customer booking (select barber, service, time slot).
	•	Admin manual booking.
	4.	Availability Logic:
	•	Write logic to calculate available time slots based on:
	•	Barber working hours.
	•	Duration of services.
	•	Existing appointments.
	5.	Frontend:
	•	Use Django templates for a simple UI.
	•	Integrate a JavaScript library like FullCalendar to display schedules.
	6.	Notifications:
	•	Use django.core.mail for email notifications.
	•	Optional: Add SMS notifications using Twilio or similar.

Stretch Goals for MVP

If you want to make it slightly more impressive:
	1.	Responsive UI:
	•	Use Bootstrap for mobile-friendly design.
	2.	Customer Registration:
	•	Allow customers to create accounts and view their bookings.
	3.	Advanced Scheduling Logic:
	•	Handle overlapping appointments or buffer times between bookings.
	4.	Basic Analytics:
	•	Show total bookings per barber or service.
